# Titanic
This project is about data and code related to the analysis of Titanic dataset.  This is my first end-to-end data analysis project using python.  It's a good start with the titanic dataset!

In this project, there are 3 parts: script, titanic dataset and results.

## Script
The data analysis script is in jupyter notebook format.  

## Titanic dataset
The dataset is in csv format and downloaded from Kaggle.

## Results
The results is a pdf document, with written analysis and graphs.

I personally maintain and contribute to this project.  If you have any questions with my project, please feel free to comment and I will try to solve the issue as soon as possible.
